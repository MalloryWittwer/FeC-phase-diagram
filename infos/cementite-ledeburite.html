<h3>Cementite + Ledeburite</h3>
<p>
  Cementite (Fe<sub>3</sub>C) is an iron carbide with orthorombic crystal
  structure. It is hard, brittle, and ferromagnetic. It is also metastable;
  under very slow cooling, or by maintaining the alloy above 723Â°C during a heat
  treatment, cementite can decompose into ferrite and graphite.
